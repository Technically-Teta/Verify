### To work on your frontend
* Go to localhost:3000 to see the main  page
* The Main page (CSS still loading) will display and say the app name`
* Form page shows  the form that the new user uses to create their page
* Form will open up the user profile page
* Buttons on the Profile page will show the Organization forms and the Volunteer forms to have the user complete them


### Nice-to-Have
* I would like the user to receive a QR code after completing the full registration.
* I want an animated home page to show the logo
* OAuth to link to the user form to use it for account login for continued use.
