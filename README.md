## About Verify-ID
[Back to Contents](#contents)
**Verify-ID** The time/date verification app to track your commitment to community service!
#### Where it all began and where it's going.....
I remember the first time I volunteered for an organization. I was 16 and helped families find toys for their kids at the toys for tots drive in my hometown of Minneapolis, MN. My love of volunteerism and giving back to the community started at that time. Since then I have volunteered in dozens of organizations and even worked for an altruistic nonprofit aimed at ending homelessness. This project is important to me because I want to create a tool that will not only help volunteers stay on track with the hours they give to the organization but I want it to encourage others to volunteer knowing there is an easy and transparent way for them to record their hours. This app will be a feature in a later dating app that I am designing.

## Future Developments
[Back to Contents](#contents)

As a stretch goal, I want to implement O-Auth into my project to create an actual notification that goes to an organization(admin) email to notify them that someone wants their verification for volunteering. I have never worked with this process before but if I can get all of my other functions and components to work I would really like to implement this. Also to include a QR code that can be easily scanned by the admin team at the organizations. 
I would also like a very hightech clean looking user interface. I have been experimenting with using certain particles on the home screen and I would like to aim for this to polish the project as well as using more css. In order of priorities I want to prioritize doing the css over the OAuth because CSS has only been minimal on my prior projects and I would like to kick it up a notice for this next project. My future goal is to add Verify-ID to my Dating app that I am working on.

### Verify-ID App Set up instructions


# Step-by-Step Instructions: Using This Template to Start The APP
You can follow these instructions and code along with the video - [setup instructions working](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tthmdat3n3vp3be/SettingUpTemplate.mov?dl=0)

### To create the whole project
1. Go to your source directory in your Terminal and run the command `git clone [(https://github.com/Technically-Teta/Verify.git)]
![You will see something like this in your terminal.](https://github.com/Yosolita1978/screenshoots/blob/main/template/Screen%20Shot%202022-03-20%20at%207.50.46%20PM.png?raw=true)

2. Once the app is installed in visual code, type `npm start` in the client and server now Both servers should now run with `npm start.


### To install the font awesome svg's 
3. Watch this short movie to know what to install to see the Icons used. There should be 1 icon displayed on the profile page:

### To work on your frontend
* Go to localhost:3000 to see the main  page
* The Main page (CSS still loading) will display and say the app name`
* Form page shows  the form that the new user uses to create their page
* Form will open up the user profile page
* Buttons on the Profile page will show the Organization forms and the Volunteer forms to have the user complete them


### Nice-to-Have
* I would like the user to receive a QR code after completing the full registration.
* I want an animated home page to show the logo
* OAuth to link to the user form to use it for account login for continued use.
